This is a simple linear algebra math library in Common-Lisp.
It provides some simple algorithms commonly used for computer
graphics, like rotation and transformations.

The aim is to have algorithms that work on simple vector/matrix types,
but can also be mapped over a flat array of this vector types. 

This library is mainly a test bed for me, to experiment with macros,
the type system and micro optimizations.
